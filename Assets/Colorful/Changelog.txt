2.1.1
- Added a "Scanlines Offset" option to the "Analog TV" effect to scroll the scanlines upwards/downwards.

2.1
- New effect, "Vintage" comes with 19 fast Instagram filters : 1977, Amaro, Brannan, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, LoFi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Walden, Willow, X-Pro II.

2.0.2
- Fixed a bug with "Lookup Filter" in linear mode.

2.0.1
- Fixed a HDR bug with the "Lookup Filter".
- The "Lookup Filter" documentation has been updated. Make sure the "Aniso Level" on your LUTs is set to 0.

2.0
- Added a new quickstart launcher when you import or update Colorful.
- Added "About Colorful" and "Colorful Manual" in the Help menu.
- Bumped the minimum Unity version to 4.3. If for some reason you need a version compatible with Unity 3.5, please contact me.
- New effect, "Contrast Vignette". The old "Fast Vignette" plays on darkness and saturation, this new one focuses on darkness and contrast enhancement which results in a more photographic look.
- Added a "Center" property to "Fast Vignette" to change the center point.
- Massive optimizations to the "Hue / Saturation / Value" shader.
- The "Hue / Saturation / Value" effect now comes with an optional advanced mode. This mode is a bit slower but way more powerful as you can now work separately on reds, yellows, greens, cyans, blues and magentas (like Photoshop).
- The "Vibrance" effect now comes with an optional advanced mode which uses a different algorithm and let you tweak how channels (RGB) are affected.
- The "Levels" effect editor has been rewritten from scratch. It's now more efficient and comes with a new "Auto B&W" feature (see the doc). Its public API hasn't changed so it should be compatible with the old one.
- Global cleanup pass and minor optimizations on all editor classes and shaders.
- Lots of UI fixes & usability tweaks.
- A few documentation fixes & additions.

1.7.1
- Added "Auto Timer" & "Auto Phase" options to "Wiggle" and "Analog TV".
- Added icons to the components to make them easier to spot.
